# power_bi_report
This is visual represenation of a dataset that I found on Kaggle. I used Python for cleansing the data and Power BI for its visualisation.

- Here is the link to the dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/aungpyaeap/supermarket-sales (***supermarket_sales.csv***)
- Here are the Python script used for data cleansing ***data_cleansing.py*** and the modified csv file ***supermarket_sales_edited.csv***
- The ***supermarket_sales_edited.csv*** file was used for building a report in Power BI (***Supermarket sales.pbix***)

I hope you will like it ðŸ™‚
